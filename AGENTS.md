# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Repo rules

- **Verify claims against code and DB, not docs or notes.** Shipped-state
  comments and older docs drift; the code is the record.
- **Inngest step IDs are a stability contract.** Completed steps replay by ID
  string; renaming/renumbering strands in-flight runs across a deploy. Change
  step shape only between runs, and re-register after function changes:
  `curl -X PUT https://app.verbatimintel.com/api/inngest`.
- **Tests are pure-logic only** (`lib/**/*.test.ts`, vitest — no network, DB,
  or GPT). New pure pipeline logic gets a test; don't mock the world to test
  I/O glue.
- **The Supabase client is untyped** (no `Database` generic). Reads past 1000
  rows must use `selectAll` (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`) — a bare `.select()`
  silently caps at 1000.
- **Client-facing copy is calibrated**: no pipeline jargon (T#, Pass C, run),
  no raw scores; "comments" vs "conversations" have fixed meanings
  (`lib/calibration.ts` GLOSSARY). Copy claims about behavior must match the
  code (a page once claimed "no email is sent" while Resend sent).
- **Costs are real**: gather scripts spend Apify money; synthesis calls spend
  OpenAI. Prefer inspectors/dry-run flags (`run-relevance.ts`, `--no-merge`,
  send-report's default preview) when iterating.
- `.env.local` holds real production credentials — never commit it, never
  print its values into logs or command output.
